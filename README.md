## Summary

This is a website showcasing the exhibition 'More Abstract / Mais abstratas' by artist Pedro Victor Brandão, held at Galeria Portas Vilaseca, featuring digital versions of the works.

## Description

The website www.moreabstract.xyz showcases the exhibition 'More Abstract', by Pedro Victor Brandão. The exhibition was held at the Portas Vilaseca art gallery in Rio de Janeiro in 2023. The website development was commissioned by the gallery and carried out by me.

The idea of the website is not to replace a visit to the gallery, but to add an extra layer to the visit. On the website, visitors can see the digital versions of the artworks presented in the gallery. These artworks have been published as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the website ensures visitors have permanent access to them.

In addition to getting to know and enjoy the artist's abstract and conceptual works, with access to the complete technical specifications and images of each work, visitors can also purchase the works through the website. All they have to do is connect their digital cryptocurrency wallet and make the transaction. In the case of one of the series of works ('View to nothingness'), when purchasing the digital copy, the visitor is entitled to a physical copy of the work.

Cryptocurrency transactions are still not well-known to the general public. Therefore, the website also contains an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section, containing a series of explanations about the concepts that govern the so-called Web3, non-fungible tokens, and cryptocurrencies. This section also addresses the issue of the authenticity of digital works, to better guide potential buyers.

The website design is minimalist and intuitive, with a clean and user-friendly interface. It was created to appeal to both visitors interested in the artist's work, as well as collectors, investors, and other potential buyers and clients of the gallery.

## Technical Specifications

The project was written in the React 18 syntax, using the Next.js 13 route structure.

For the interfaces of interaction with non-fungible tokens, widgets provided by the Manifold platform were used. These widgets, when imported into a React website, make requests to the Manifold API to populate the technical specifications and images of the works with the data of each item. At the time of the development of this website, this feature had just been made available by Manifold - which made me have to contact the developers of the team to solve some errors that still existed in their implementation. It was a great learning experience for me, and I am pleased to have contributed to the ecosystem of that platform in this way.

The website is fully responsive, providing a great experience for users on desktop, mobile, or tablet.

The introductory text and the FAQ section are available in a bilingual Portuguese-English version, provided through the 'next-i18next' dependency. The moreabstract.xyz domain was purchased and set up via Google Domains and Vercel.

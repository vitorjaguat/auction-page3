    "intro": "MORE ABSTRACT is a solo exhibition by Pedro Victor Brandão presented at Portas Vilaseca Gallery from April 26 to June 24, 2023. In this manual, you will find frequently asked questions about how to interact with the tokens listed on the website.",
    "instructions": "INSTRUCTIONS",
    "q1": "What is a non-fungible token (NFT)?",
    "a1": "A non-fungible token (NFT) is a type of a digital deed that is inscribed on a public internet registry. Simply put, it can be understood as a container for metadata and media content, thus being a means of artistic and financial expression that allows for the self-issuance of scarce digital assets. For more details on this technology and its applications, you can watch <a className='text-slate-300' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLS2mJsS36g' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Episode #8 of Triangle Network TV</a> where artist Pedro Victor Brandão discusses the fundamentals of this technology from the creation of <a href='https://twitter.com/acerolafund' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Acerola Fund</a>, a public collection of cryptomedia works made by artists from the Global South.",
    "q2": "On which blockchain were the tokens issued? And in which standard?",
    "a2": "All the works presented in the MORE ABSTRACT exhibition were minted on the Ethereum blockchain. The works from the <em>Detremura</em>, <em>Cloud, continent, island</em>, and <em>View to nothingness</em> were minted with the ERC-721 standard, as unique pieces. The editions of the work <em>Faucet</em>, from <em>Prepared screen</em> series are issued as ERC-1155 and can be collected for free (except for the gas fee) on the same page.",
    "q3": "How can I collect the works issued as non-fungible tokens?",
    "a3": "To collect the works, you will need a non-custodial wallet that has a balance corresponding to the price of the works in Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. If you don't have Ether, you can buy it on an exchange like <a href='https://foxbit.com.br' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>https://foxbit.com.br</a> or <a href='https://coinbase.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>https://coinbase.com</a>.",
    "q4": "How can I have a non-custodial wallet? Do I need to pay for one?",
    "a4": "You can install Metamask through the website <a href='https://metamask.io' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>https://metamask.io</a>, for free.",
    "q5": "What is a non-custodial wallet? Is it safe?",
    "a5": "It is a digital cryptocurrency wallet that is installed in your internet browser as an extension (add-on), in which the custody of the assets is not centralized by any third party entity (like a bank, for instance), but by the person who owns the wallet itself. It is recommended to use Metamask, the most widely used wallet. When installing Metamask in your browser, you will be asked to securely note down a secret recovery phrase (seed phrase) of 12 words that gives you access to the wallet. <u>It is very important to have a backup of this phrase, preferably physically and never share it with anyone, because with this phrase you (or anyone in possession of it) can access the wallet on any device.</u> As a browser extension, Metamask has proven to be quite secure, requiring a minimum amount of personal information sharing. For more details on its operation, visit <a href='https://metamask.io/faqs/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>https://metamask.io/faqs/</a>.",
    "q6": "Is it necessary to use the Metamask wallet? Can I use another wallet?",
    "a6": "You can use other wallets that operate on the Ethereum blockchain, but using Metamask is recommended. It is compatible with many decentralized applications (such as this page) and also with most internet browsers. It is considered safe because it is frequently updated in rigorous audit processes. If you are interested in discovering other wallets that are compatible with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), visit <a href='https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/</a>.",
    "q7": "The works in the series VIEW TO NOTHINGNESS and DETREMURA are physical and digital. How does this affect the purchase?",
    "a7": "For all the works in the exhibition, there are two ways to acquire them: (1) direct acquisition in the gallery with traditional means of payment - and in the case of the work that is also a physical item, the buyer can later indicate a digital wallet for the token to be sent; or (2) acquisition on this page, where the purchase is made with Ether and the buyer can later indicate a physical address for the work to be sent.",
    "q8": "How do the commissions work for the gallery and the Acerola Fund?",
    "a8": "Works sold as tokens have the following distribution: 45% for the artist; 45% for the gallery, and 10% for the Acerola Fund.",
    "q9": "Why weren't the works from TOTALITIES series, which are also in the exhibition, minted as NFTs?",
    "a9": "The works in this series are paintings, acrylics on canvas, thus 'naturally' non-fungible, and there is not much sense in just making a tokenized copy of them.",
    "q10": "Can I download the files contained in the tokens to save or print my own copies?",
    "a10": "Yes.",
    "q11": "Is the work FAUCET from DETREMURA series free?",
    "a11": "Yes. Anyone who wants to collect one or more editions that will be minted during the course of the exhibition will need to connect their wallet to the website and make a transaction, paying only a gas fee. The number of editions will be variable, but there will always be a limit, with a total number of tokens that can be claimed for each edition minted. If a certain edition is minted out, people can make purchases on secondary markets if they wish.",
    "q12": "What is a gas fee?",
    "a12": "The Ethereum gas fee is a fee that users pay to perform transactions on the network. This fee is calculated in gas, which is a unit of measurement that represents the amount of computational resources needed to execute a transaction. The value of the gas fee varies according to the supply and demand of the network, being higher when demand is high. People who use the network pay this fee to incentivize validators to process their transactions more quickly, making the Ethereum network more efficient and fast.",
    "q13": "I have other questions that were not addressed in this manual. What should I do?",
    "a13": "You can send an email to pedrovictorbr@pm.me with your question. It will be answered as soon as possible."
